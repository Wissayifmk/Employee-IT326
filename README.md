# Employees-IT326

  We decided to work on the Arab Employee dataset, which has information about how much people get paid based on their qualifications, where they live, and how much experience they have. We're doing this because we really care about making sure that pay is fair and that everyone knows what they should be earning. By gathering this data, we want to help Arab professionals by giving them accurate information so they can negotiate for fair salaries and make smart choices about their careers. Our big goal is to use the data we collect to make the job market better and more equal for everyone in the Arab region.
  
  After we chose the suitable dataset for our goul, we started exploring the data by calculating the central tendency. To have a clear view, we used some graphs the help us in understanding our dataset and rach our goul. Furthermore, we did a preprocessing on the dataset such as checking for missing values and detect them, removing outlier, Normalization and discretization. Additionally, we decided to fill in the missing values using the average; since we have 72 values missing in years, this will affect our results’ accuracy. As well as for normalizations, we did it in the numeric values such as salary, permission, job rate and years to reduce the huge and distracting values, which cause major issues.
