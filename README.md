# Employees-IT326

  We decided to work on the Arab Employee dataset, which has information about how much people get paid based on their qualifications, where they live, and how much experience they have. We're doing this because we really care about making sure that pay is fair and that everyone knows what they should be earning. By gathering this data, we want to help Arab professionals by giving them accurate information so they can negotiate for fair salaries and make smart choices about their careers. Our big goal is to use the data we collect to make the job market better and more equal for everyone in the Arab region.
